Sentiment Analysis of Twitter Data
Overview
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data to classify tweets into two categories: "Happy" and "Depressed." Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the emotional tone or sentiment expressed in text data. In this project, we use natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning to automatically classify tweets based on their sentiment.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: The project includes data cleaning and text preprocessing steps to prepare the Twitter data for analysis. This includes removing noise, tokenization, and converting text data into numerical features.

Machine Learning Classifiers: Four different machine learning classifiers are implemented: Decision Tree, Linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Naive Bayes. These classifiers are trained on the preprocessed data to classify tweets as "Happy" or "Depressed."

Evaluation Metrics: The project provides comprehensive evaluation metrics for each classifier, including accuracy, confusion matrices, and classification reports. These metrics help assess the performance of the sentiment analysis models.

Visualization: The project includes data visualization using the Seaborn library to create an attractive bar chart that visually compares the accuracy of the different classifiers. This visualization enhances the project's presentation.
